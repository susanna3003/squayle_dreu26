# DREU Research Log

**Student:** Susanna Quayle
**Mentor:** Dr. Tiffany Barnes

This repository contains your weekly research log for the Distributed Research Experiences for Undergraduates (DREU) program. It covers 10 weeks. All 10 log files are pre-created — you fill them in week by week.


## Repository Structure

```

## How to Submit Your Weekly Log

1. Open the current week's file in `logs/` (e.g., `logs/week-03.md`).
2. Fill in the **Dates** field and all three sections.
3. Commit and push your changes before the weekly deadline (Sunday 11:59 PM).

You do not need to create new files — all 10 are already in the repo waiting for you.

## Log Format Requirements

Each weekly log **must** follow this exact structure for automated validation to pass:

```markdown
# Week N

**Dates:** MM-DD to MM-DD

## Goals
...

## Approach and Implementation
...

## Results
...
```

The following fields are required and must appear exactly as written:

| Field | Example |
|---|---|
| H1 title | `# Week 3` |
| Dates line | `**Dates:** 06-16 to 06-22` |
| Section 1 | `## Goals` |
| Section 2 | `## Approach and Implementation` |
| Section 3 | `## Results` |

The first three sections are required and must each contain at least one non-empty line of content. A fourth section, `## Notes`, is optional — include it for questions, follow-up items, or anything else that doesn't fit the main sections.

See **EXAMPLE.md** for a complete filled-out sample.

## Checking Your Log

You can validate your own log at any time by running the check script locally:

```bash
python check_log.py logs/week-NN.md
```

Or push your changes — if a GitHub Action is configured in this repo, it will automatically validate your latest log and show a pass/fail status on your commit.
